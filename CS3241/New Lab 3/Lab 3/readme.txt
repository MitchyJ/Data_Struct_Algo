Drawing 1:-
· Primitives and transformations you have used
  -GL_POLYGON
  -glRotatef(), glTranslatef(), glScalef()

· What you are drawing
  -3D sphere with multiple shading(smooth,flat,wireframe,vertices)

· Methods you have modified 
  – changed glclearcolor() in main for background color 
  - added new functions 
 
· Any other things I should know?
  -added normal calculation for proper highlighting
  -for smooth shading the normal is basically the vertices itself 
  - for flat shading I took the midpoint of each small polygon

Drawing 3:-
· Primitives and transformations you have used
  -GL_POLYGON
  -glRotatef(), glTranslatef(), glScalef()

· What you are drawing
  -Magical Wish Wand with multiple shading(smooth,flat,wireframe,vertices)

· Methods you have modified 
  – changed glclearcolor() in main for background color 
  - added multiple new functions 
 
· Any other things I should know?
  -the main sphere of the wand composed of small sections of a sphere and rotated
to form that
  -added normal calculation for proper highlighting
  -for smooth shading the normal is basically the vertices itself 
  - for flat shading I took the midpoint of each small polygon 

· What is the coolest thing(s) in your drawing
  - Its a non existent wand(i.e. not a replica from existing anime) created with \
my imagination with the help of opengl :)


Drawing 4:-
· Primitives and transformations you have used
  -GL_POLYGON
  -glRotatef(), glTranslatef(), glScalef()

· What you are drawing
  -Percussion drum set with multiple shading(smooth,flat,wireframe,vertices)

· Methods you have modified 
  – changed glclearcolor() in main for background color 
  - added new functions 
 
· Any other things I should know?
  -added normal calculation for proper highlighting
  -for smooth shading the normal is basically the vertices itself 
  - for flat shading I took the midpoint of each small polygon 

· What is the coolest thing(s) in your drawing
  -instead of only 3D, i used some 2D drawings to make the model look more realistic
  -The arrangement is according how an actual band set should be ,only thing missing 
is the drummer!
