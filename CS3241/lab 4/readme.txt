extra features:

i. I have added function "drawtext()" to display different messages on screen during 
key press.

ii. I have drawn an extra drawing with the curve and saved to saveFile2.txt which
can be displayed on screen by pressing "b" or "B" key, 's' or 'S' to overwrite 
saveFile2.txt 

iii. I have added an extra case for keypress which is 'z' or 'Z' which allows 
me to delete the last point drawn (undo)
